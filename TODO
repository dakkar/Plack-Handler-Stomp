- multiple servers, looping between them
- exception handling
- types module, stricter validation, coercions
- stomp replies
- delegated logging
- path_info with printf-style substitutions
- tests against real broker
- tests for sub_id-based path mapping
- tests for failure modes

Then:
- Catalyst script to load destinations from config/controllers
- Catalyst controller base, or action class, for sub-dispatch (smarter
  than Catalyst::Controller::MessageDriven)
- tests against a Catalyst app
